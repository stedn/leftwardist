<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 â€“ 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic, and journalist. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded intellectual and a controversial public figure. He contributed to New Statesman, The Nation, The Weekly Standard, The Atlantic, London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, Slate, Free Inquiry and Vanity Fair.</p>
