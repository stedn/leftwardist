    <p>The Leftwardist is stories to imagine an equitable and sustainable world. Authors write social commentary about the ways our current societal inequities are detrimental to humanity’s common well-being and speculative fiction about the ways we could reduce these inequities, live in balance with nature and create a world that lets all people enjoy life for generations to come.</p>

<p>Our goal is to shift people’s attitudes towards a more egalitarian society in balance with the natural limits of our planet.  We seek to propagate stories and ideas centered on transitioning to a fair and sustainable world.  We seek to do this by making people think of all the small assumptions they make about where we are in humanity’s development and what changes—small and large—we can make to move our world forward into a better future.</p>
